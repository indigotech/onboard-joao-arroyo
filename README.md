## Steps to run and debug

- After cloning the project, run the command below in the root directory:

`$ npm install`

- To compile only, you can run:

`$ npm run tsc`

- With the node_modules folder ready, to start the server run the command below and go to http://localhost:4000/:

`$ npm run start`

- If you want to interact with the database, first it's necessary to run:

`$ docker compose up -d`

Then one can use the following script to add an user to the database:

`$ npm run test-typeorm`

In order to stop it, run:

`$ docker compose stop`

Other scripts, to lint and format the files, are defined in the package.json file.
